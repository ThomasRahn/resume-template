resume-template
===============

A simple and formal HTML5 template for resume's and curriculum vitaes that makes use of the _Bootstrap_ framework and the _Source Sans Pro_ typeface. The design also accounts for print usage, with slight modifications via CSS media types that allow for a nicer printed variant.

The template is self-contained, with _Bootstrap_ being brought in via [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) and the _Source Sans Pro_ typeface via [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).


Usage
-----

The source is simply laid out and very much self-documenting.

The profile image should be cropped to a 1:1 ratio (i.e. a square).

Topic sections on your resume are all embodied under the `#topics` block.

The sections themselves are contained under `section` blocks which have a `h3` heading to denote the section.

Individual items pertaining to the particular topic are nested within `subtopic` sections.

By no means are you limited to the existing design considerations; you may change things as you wish and come up with your own identity. The template exists as a nice starting point.
